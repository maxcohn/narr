""" README

Why?

I like esoteric languages

I needed to learn NFA simulation

"""

"""
TODO

Add comments ---- #?

build out examples/tests

add support for epsilon transitions
    Maybe done?


Comment so it is clear on the nfa simulations process

Have a clear version and a raw version
    Compare speeds

Make some example nfas

Make a program that generates the input for this interpreter from a regular expression


In clean version
    NFA object
    Transition object
    Good error reporting
